A blackbody is an object that absorbs all incident radiation, regardless of frequency or angle of incidence, and does not reflect or transmit any of it. Instead, it re-emits radiation at a rate that depends solely on its temperature.\\n\\nThe radiation emitted by a blackbody covers all wavelengths and intensities, creating a continuous spectrum that peaks at a wavelength corresponding to the temperature of the object. At room temperature, most of the radiation is in the infrared part of the spectrum. As the temperature increases, the peak of the spectrum shifts towards the visible and then to the ultraviolet range.\\n\\nThe distribution of this radiation with respect to wavelength is described by Planck's law, which states that the spectral radiance of a blackbody at a given temperature is a function of the wavelength and temperature, and is proportional to the Wien's displacement law, which states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature.\\n\\nBlackbody radiation is a fundamental concept in physics and is crucial for understanding the behavior of heat transfer, the nature of light, and the basis of quantum mechanics.\""

Qin Shi Huang's reign was marked by significant administrative, economic, and cultural reforms, including the standardization of writing, weights, measures, and the construction of the first version of the Great Wall. He is also known for his mausoleum, which includes the famous Terracotta Army.
